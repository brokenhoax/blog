          I'm building a mockup in Figma for a new feature at work and I've been
          asked to include a range slider that allows a user to change "synonym

          Figma would be a worthy challenge and one worth sharing. What's more,

        <p>
          If you think about where you've encountered a slider in a user
          interface, you might agree that a typical slider consists of three
          parts: a handle, a bar upon which the handle slides, and some scale
          indicator that increments and decrements as you adjust the slider.
          Most sliders increment in single digits or, at the most, no more than
          two decimal points, but to build out such a granular slider in Figma
          wouldn't be practical. Luckily, we don't build apps in Figma we build
          prototypes of apps (which means they don't have to be perfect
          representations of the real thing).
        </p>
        <p>
          That said, we'll be building three sliders in this tutorial in order
          for the slider to, well, slide! The first slider will represent the
          slider if it were at the lowest point of the scale—in our case zero or
          “0”. The second slider will represent the slider at half scale (0.5)
          and the third at full scale (1). We'll create a slider “Component”
          which has three “Variants” each representing one of our three slider
          states of “zero”, “half”, and “full”. Before we start building our
          slider, let's give it a home to live in within Figma. Let's create a
          new frame and call it “slider”.

        </h3>
        <p>
          Now that we know what we're building and where it should live, let's
          work on the first piece of our slider—the slider handle:
        </p>
        {/* Slider Handle Image */}
        <ToggleImage params={images["1"]}></ToggleImage>
        <p>
          Our handle will be a simple circle shape handle consisting of two
          circles: a big, outer circle and a smaller, inner circle for added
          style. We'll kick things off in Figma by creating a circle shape with
          a width and height of 32 x 32 pixels and a color of dark blue. Our
          inner circle will be white with a measurement of 16 x 16 pixels. We'll
          place the inner circle directly in the center of the larger circle and
          we'll frame them together by selecting both and clicking “Frame
          Selection”. Let's name that frame “handle”, drag it into our “slider”
          frame, and we can move on to adding our slider bar.

        <ToggleImage params={images["2"]}></ToggleImage>
        <p>
          Next up is the slider bar which we'll have positioned horizontally
          with the zero scale indicator on the left and the one scale indicator
          on the right. Now, creating the slider bar is a bit deceiving in Figma
          because the bar should look different for each of our states. Our
          empty state will have a single, light-blue colored slider bar with the
          slider handle all the way to the left. Our half state will have two
          bars of equal length with the slider handle in the center of the two.
          Our full state will have a single, dark-blue colored slider bar with
          the slider handle to the far right.
        </p>
        <p>
          Why the different colors? When the user moves the slider from empty to
          half we need to indicate to the user that we're incrementing the
          scale. We can do that with our slider indicators but we also want to
          make this more visually obvious (and interesting) by using color. The
          respective colored bars indicate to the user that the slider is
          incrementing the scale when the handle is moved from left to right and
          right to left.
        </p>
        <p>
          We can make our slider bars any length but each variant's slider bar
          length should be uniform. Let's go with 256 pixels which means that,
          for our half-state slider the dark-blue slider bar will be 128px and
          the light-blue slider bar will be 128px for a total of 256 pixels.
          Since we're starting with an empty state slider we'll just create one
          slider bar with a color of light-blue and a width of 256px. We'll now
          place our slider handle center and to the far left of our slider bar
          and we'll select both the slider bar and handle and put them in a
          frame. We'll then turn that frame into a component which we'll name
          “empty”. Once we have our Figma component, we can create two
          additional variants which we'll call “half” and “full”. You'll notice
          that these variants are identical to our default “empty” variant, so
          we'll need to make some tweaks to make each variant represent their
          respective states. Don't forget to add two slider bars for our “half”
          state!

        <p>
          Now that we've built our slider component and variants, let's discuss
          how we'll make our slider interactive. Since we aren't writing code in
          Figma, we have to first think about how we can accomplish this with
          animations or, as Figma calls them, “interactions”. So what type of
          interaction would we use in Figma to make our slider functional?
          Typical interactions that a user might have with a web app include
          clicking their mouse or typing with their keyboard; however, a typical
          slider interaction involves a user clicking on the slider handle and
          dragging the slider horizontally or vertically to increase or decrease
          the scale as is indicated by the slider scale indicators. Luckily for
          us, Figma has an “on-drag” interaction that we can use.{" "}
        </p>
        <p>
          Now we need to think about what happens when a user clicks the slider
          handle and drags it. If the “dragging” action is the cause, then
          what's the effect? In our case, we'll choose “Change To” as the effect
          of the user dragging the slider and our “change to” effect will point
          to the next logical slider variant. For instance, if a user was to
          click and drag the slider handle on our empty state slider then our
          Figma interaction would logically “change to” our next slider variant
          of “half”. If the user continued to drag the slider handle from the
          “half” state further up the slider scale, then we should set the
          “change to” action to change from the “half” state to the “full”
          state. Obviously, this interaction wouldn't be as as a real slider
          since the slider, in our case, can only be in three positions, but it
          gets the point across and, if you really have the time, you can choose
          to make more variants that go win smaller increments (such as in
          increments of .10 ranging from 0 to 1. For the purposes of this
          tutorial, we'll keep things simple.

        <p>
          Our sliders look really good but there's a few problems we haven't
          considered yet and that's reusability and responsiveness. If we want
          to use this slider in our app then we can simply drop it in as is, but
          what if we want to make it bigger? Or, perhaps we're fine with the
          size of the slider but what if whomever is reviewing our prototype
          wants to shrink or grow their size of their viewport (screen)? What
          effect will that have on our slider? Unfortunately, because we haven't
          set any constraints on the pieces of our slider we cannot expect it to
          maintain the positioning of each part of the slider and we can expect
          our slider to get distorted if the size of it, or the user's viewport,
          is changed.
        </p>
        <p>
          With Figma's “constraints” feature we can set constraints on the
          slider bar(s), handle, and even the frames that encapsulate the pieces
          of our slider. When it comes to constraints all you need to know is
          that the constraints applied to the Figma object are relative to its
          parent object. For instance, with our slider handle, the inner circle
          is the child object and the outer circle it lives within is its parent
          object. Furthermore, the outer circle's parent object is the frame
          that it lives within.
        </p>
        <ToggleImage params={images["8"]}></ToggleImage>
        <p>
          That said, for our empty state, our slider bar will have its
          horizontal constraint set to “left and right” and a vertical
          constraint set to “top and bottom”. Our empty state's slider handle
          frame will have a horizontal constraint of “left” and a vertical
          constraint of “top and bottom”. Our empty state slider handle outer
          circle will have a horizontal constraint of “left” and a vertical
          constraint of “top and bottom” and our empty state slider handle inner
          circle will have a horizontal and vertical constraint both set to
          “center”.
        </p>
        {/* Empty Slider Constraints */}
        <ToggleImage params={images["4"]}></ToggleImage>
        <p>
          Our half state's constraints is probably the trickiest part of this
          Figma project. Both slider bars will have a horizontal constraint of
          “scale” and a vertical constraint of “top and bottom”. Our slider
          handle frame will have a horizontal constraint of “center” so that it
          maintains its centered position on the slider bar and a vertical
          constraint of “top and bottom”. Our outer circle will have a
          horizontal constraint of “left and right” and a vertical constraint of
          “center” and our inner circle will maintain the same “center / center”
          constraints as was described above.
        </p>
        {/* Half Slider Constraints */}
        <ToggleImage params={images["5"]}></ToggleImage>
        <p>
          Last but not least, our full state's constraints are similar to our
          empty state's constraints but inverted for the slider handle frame.
          So, our slider bar will have a horizontal constraint of “left and
          right” and a vertical constraint of “top and bottom” whereas the
          slider handle frame will have a horizontal constraint of “right” and a
          vertical constraint of “top and bottom”. Our slider handle outer
          circle will have a horizontal constraint of “top and bottom” and a
          vertical constraint of “left and right” and our inner circle will have
          a horizontal and vertical constraint both set to “center”.
        </p>

        <p>
          It took me a little while to understand how constraints worked and I
          came to a better understanding by trying different settings and
          testing their effect. So, change one or two constraints, grab the
          variant frame and shrink and grow it to see what happens. Viola! Our
          slider prototype is now ready to be demonstrated. Pat yourself on the
          back, grab another cup of coffee, and let's go! 🎉
